# Data Visualization Using Circos
## Installation
Circos is a command line tool (e.g. no GUI) and is perl based. It would be easier to run it on a mac computer (or linux). If you are using Mac OS, perl is most likely pre-installed. 

To check if perl is installed, type the following command in the terminal:
```
which perl
```
If the terminal returns something like: 
```
/usr/bin/perl
```
It means perl is already installed.

To check the version of perl:
```
perl --version
```
This is perl 5, version 18, subversion 4 (v5.18.4) built for darwin-thread-multi-2level
(with 2 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)
